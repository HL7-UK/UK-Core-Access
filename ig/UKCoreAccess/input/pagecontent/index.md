This implementation guide specifies the requirements for a FHIR endpoint providing read-only access for direct care
and subject of care access.

It uses UK-specific resource profiles defined in the [UK Core](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide/Home?version=1.0.0) implementation guide.

### Locate a FHIR Server
It is assumed that URLs for FHIR Servers will be found from sources such as:
- local configuration
- local, regional or national directory services
